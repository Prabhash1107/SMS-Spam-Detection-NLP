# SMS-Spam-Detection-NLP
The issue is that SMS spam presents privacy and security threats, rendering conventional screening techniques useless. This project creates a machine learning model for spam detection based on natural language processing.
Goals:
Create a model for effective spam detection.
NLP approaches are used to preprocess SMS messages.
Assess the accuracy of machine learning classifiers.

Methodology:
 Tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization are used to preprocess SMS data. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to train and assess machine learning models (Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Key Findings:
 SVM using TF-IDF features outperforms rule-based techniques and minimizes false positives and negatives, achieving 98% accuracy.

In conclusion, scalable and precise SMS spam detection is made possible by NLP and machine learning. Real-time filtering and deep learning can be investigated in future research.
